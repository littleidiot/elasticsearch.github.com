p. The directory layout of an installation is as follows:

|_. Type |_. Description |_. Default Location |_. Setting |
|*home*|Home of elasticsearch installation||@path.home@|
|*bin*|Binary scripts including @elasticsearch@ (to start a node)|@{path.home}/bin@||
|*conf*|Configuration files including @elasticsearch.yml@|@{path.home}/config@|@path.conf@|
|*data*|The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated on the node. Can hold multiple locations.|@{path.home}/data@|@path.data@|
|*work*|Transient files that are used by different nodes.|@{path.home}/work@|@path.work@|
|*logs*|Log file location|@{path.home}/logs@|@path.logs@|

p. Multiple data locations facilitate striping. The striping is simple, placing whole files in one of the locations and deciding where to place the file based on the location with the greatest free space. Note that there are not multiple copies of the same data, in this way it is similar to RAID 0. Though simple, it should provide a good solution for people that don't want to mess with raids and the like. Here is how it is configured:

<pre>
path.data: /mnt/first,/mnt/second
</pre>

Or the in an array format:

<pre>
path.data: ["/mnt/first", "/mnt/second"]
</pre>
